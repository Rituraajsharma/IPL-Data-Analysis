# IPL-Data-Analysis

# Overview

This project performs Data Analysis on Indian Premier League (IPL) data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in match results, player performances, and team statistics. The analysis utilizes Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore and visualize the dataset.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of IPL match records, player statistics, and team performances over multiple seasons. The primary data sources include:

Matches dataset: Contains match details such as teams, venues, toss decisions, winners, and scores.

Deliveries dataset: Contains ball-by-ball data, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player-specific statistics.

# Objectives

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data formatting, and feature engineering.

Match Analysis: Examining win patterns, toss decisions, and venue-specific trends.

Player & Team Performance: Analyzing top performers, run distributions, and bowling effectiveness.

Seasonal Trends: Identifying trends across different IPL seasons.

Visualization & Insights: Creating meaningful visual representations of key findings.

# Technologies Used

# Key Findings

Teams winning the toss have a slight advantage in certain conditions.

Certain venues favor batting or bowling first based on historical results.

Top batsmen and bowlers can be identified using statistical measures like strike rate and economy rate.

Powerplay and death overs play a crucial role in match outcomes.
